# WorkIt

WorkIt is a coworking office space platform in the form of an Android mobile application that seeks to link up vacant office spaces with freelance or long-term office seekers, developed in Java.

Users can locate the nearest office space, book an office for as short as an hour or as long as multiples months and subsequently make payment, all within the app.

They would then be able to walk straight into the office, verified through the syncronization between bluetooth enabled door locks and their smartphones.

Components/functionalities developed thus far: User Interface, login/logout authentication, Bluetooth functionality, Google Maps API for user and office locations, payment screens

Components/functionalites yet to be developed: Payment processing and authentication, e-wallet/card credit integration, bluetooth door lock and smartphone syncronization
